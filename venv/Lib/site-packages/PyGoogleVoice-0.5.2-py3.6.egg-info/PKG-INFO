        Exposing the Google Voice "API" to the Python language
        ------------------------------------------------------
        
        Google Voice for Python Allows you to place calls, send sms, download voicemail, and check the
        various folders of your Google Voice Accounts.  You can use the Python API or command line script
        to schedule calls, check for new received calls/sms, or even sync your recorded voicemails/calls.
        Works for Python 2 and Python 3
